In 2021, it celebrates its 22nd year since the jottery yellow sponge became a main stay on our televisions, and we can all agree that it is <strong>only getting better!</strong>

    <p>The main characters include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spongebob Squarepants - an always happy yellow sea sponge who tries to spread cheer to all in Bikini Bottom</li>
      <li>Patrick Star - best friend to Spongebob and on the low end of the IQ scale</li>
      <li>Squidward Tentacles - drab squid who boasts about his plethora of artistic talents and dreams of becoming a famous clatinet player</li>
      <li>Mr. (Eugene) Krabs - a frugal red krab and owner of the popular Krusty Krab restaurant where Spongebob is employed</li>
      <li>Sheldon Plankton - as the name suggests, a genius plankton who lives to steal the <em>'krabby patty secret formula</em></li>
      <li>Sandy Cheeks - a brilliant squarrel whose genius inventions bring surprise outcomes to Bikini Bottom</li>
    </ul>
